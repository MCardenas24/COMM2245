	<p>I hope you have enjoyed browsing through my website and learning about me. Throughout the Fall 2023 semester at the University of New Mexico I have been learning how to create a website and code HTML and CSS in my Web Design Course, and this website has been the outcome foreverything that I learned in the Web Design course. This website has been the start of this new journey of learning how to code HTML and CSS, and creating great websites for the audience to view in the future. With learning these new skills I will be able to apply them for my future career in graphic design.	</p>
