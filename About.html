  <h2>Who I Am</h2>
	<p>My name is Manuela Cardenas and I was born and raised in Albuquerque, NM. I am a person who loves being outdoors, spending time with family. I am the first person in my family to go to college and I am majoring in Fine Art Studio, and I am focusing in Graphic Design. This is my forth year at the University of New Mexico and I hope to graduate in Spring 2024.</p>

  <p>Graphic Design is something that I love doing and hope to one day have a business of my own in this career. It has been exciting for me to be able to create logos, posters, flyers, and business cards. Now I am excited to be able to learn how to create a website and learn how to code HTML and CSS.</p></div>
