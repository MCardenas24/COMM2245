  <h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
  <p>Creating a website can be exciting to do because it gives the opportunity to show and write about great things that are about yourself or any possible topic that you can think of. The website will also allow anyone from all over the world to view something that they will find interesting.</p>
	<p>This is the first time that I am creating a website and with this website that I will be working on as an assignment, I want to be able to learn how to code HTMl and CSS. The course that I am taking during this Fall at the University of New Mexico which is called Web Design. This course is focused on teaching students how to use Dreamweaver and code HTML and CSS.  Creating this website throughtout the Fall 2023 semester, will help me learn great skills that
	  I can apply in Graphic
	  Design. The course and website will also help me learn more about journalism skills since this class is also focused in knowing and learning about writing and having great journalism skills.</p>
	<p>I hope you enjoy browsing through my website!</p>
