<h2>Who I Am</h2>
	
My name is Manuela Cardenas and I was born and raised in Albuquerque, NM. I am the first person in my family to go to college and I am majoring in Fine Art Studio. I am focusing in Graphic Design. Graphic Design is something that I love and hope to one day have a business of my own in this career. This is my forth year at the University of New Mexico and I hope to graduate in Spring 2024.

<h2>About The Website</h2>
	
This is the first time that I am creating a webiste and with this website that I will be working on as an assignment, I want to be able to learn how to code HTMl and CSS. The course that I am taking during this Fall at the University of New Mexico and this website will help me learn great skills that I can apply in Graphic Design. The course and website will also help me learn more about journalism skills.
